# Should all higher education be free, should students pay the cost of their studies or is there some middle ground ?

I think that all higher education could be free because the cost is very expansive for some university in USA. And the fact is that so many students can't study to university like YALE because they have no enough money. Today, a lot of students have to take loan and repay it. For example, Michelle OBAMA say's in 2012 : “Eight years ago, we paid off the last of our student loans. Now Barack's working make education more affordable for today's student.” So Barack Obama repay is loan during fifteen years.

However, I understand that higher education have a cost very expansive although in France, because it's an investment for future. So even if we pay 15 000€ per years for a master in France, after that you could except ear 2500€ per month and repay the loan in 10 or 15 years. So yes it's a price to access at the elite school but you have after all a big compensation.

For the moment, I think that the system is good because we have a balance between the cost of the studies and the salary after that. More Over, for people who hadn't enough money can use scholarship and have access to this elite school. But in USA, student have to pay all their studies because the government is reducing its subsidies to higher education and more and more of the real cost is being paid by students and their families. Eventually, I think that the system of France is correct, whereas the system of US is not interesting for student because at the beginning of their professional life, they have already a big debt to pay.
